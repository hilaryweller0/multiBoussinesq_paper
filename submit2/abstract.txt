Multi-fluid modelling is a promising new method of representing sub- and near-grid-scale convection allowing for consistent and accurate treatment of net mass transport by convection and of non-equilibrium dynamics . The air is partitioned into two or more fluids which may represent, for example, updrafts and the stable environment. Each fluid has its own velocity, temperature and constituents with separate equations of motion.

This paper presents two-fluid Boussinesq equations for representing under-resolved dry convection with sinking and w = 0 air in fluid 0 and rising air in fluid 1. A model for entrainment and detrainment based on divergence leads to excellent representation of the convective area fraction. Previous multi-fluid modelling of convection has used the same pressure for both fluids. This is shown to be a bad approximation and a model for the pressure difference between the fluids based on divergence is presented.

Two vertical slice test cases are developed to tune parameters and to evaluate the two-fluid equations for representing dry, sub-grid-scale convection: a buoyant rising bubble and radiative convective equilibrium. These are first simulated at high resolution and conditionally averaged based on the sign of the vertical velocity. The test cases are next simulated with the two-fluid model which reproduces the mean properties of the rising and falling fluids in one column.
