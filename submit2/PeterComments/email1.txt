I'm about half way through - comments attached as annotations. However, I doubt I'm going to have many issues with the results section. I would like to be sure the conclusions does the paper justice. 
There are numerous comments, but most are not biggies. However, major issues are:
1) I'd like to have a go at re-wording the intro section. I don't think it motivates the multi fluid approach particularly well, and also says things about other schemes (e.g. Clubb, Lappen and Randall) which are wrong.
2) The section on scale analysis really misses the point completely, and, as it stands, just tells us what the dimensions should be! For the bubble, you chose L (wrong) and for the RCE you chose B using L taken from the reference solution, which is cheating. Neither is necessary. 
3) I don't see why Fig.2 and the intro to it is in the paper. We don't compare with multi-column 2 fluid. I realise your motivation is to show how bad 'grey-zone' simulations are cf single-column multi-fluid, but that's another paper, really.

Can I send you some Latex to address 1) and 2) later this afternoon? 1) is up for discussion, of course, but better I have a go. 2) really does need to be better, and as I'd claim to have initiated putting it in, I feel it should do justice to the argument.
