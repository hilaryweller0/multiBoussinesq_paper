I had thought that you had picked up from Dan that the length-scale needed in the estimation of gamma is the boundary-layer depth or filament width. Apologies – I should have realised sooner. Dan (and I) picked up on this a couple of months ago (and I did circulate something). Dan needs a louder voice, maybe! (It so happened I was writing up the analysis at the same time.)

 

As I said, the scale analysis is more than just a dimensional analysis – it gives us some quantitative predictions. I believe that the attached needs to be in the paper (though if anyone can make it a wee bit more concise, please do). In an ideal world, we’d publish non-dimensionalized results, but I don’t think that’s needed in JAMES. Dan in particular, please check it! I don’t think there’s new science here but we must show that we’re familiar with what’s known (Dan might wish to comment re appropriate references). 

 

The key points are

    The scale analysis tell us how to get B for the RCE case in terms of external parameters. This is standard free convective boundary layer scaling available in many textbooks. You cannot just go to a high resolution and measure it! (Note how it does compare!)
    We get direct estimates of P and U – note how these compare with the numerical solutions in both cases.
    Hence we get Reynolds number. This highlights low value and means some comment on viscosity is needed.
    For the RCE case, we get an estimate of the scale of ‘intermingling’. We don’t for the rising bubble because, I think, all your diffusion is numerical, but see notes. There is an effective viscosity operating, and it may be better, in future, to have some control over it.
    Hence our estimate of gamma – this suggests you’ve used a value a little high but the right order of magnitude, and it’s only a scale analysis so I don’t see a problem.
    On the whole, these results support and, I think, strengthen the paper.
