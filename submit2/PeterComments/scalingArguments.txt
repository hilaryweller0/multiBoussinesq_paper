Re the text book BL scalings, I have pointed them out several times, including in the document I sent regarding scaling. I'm afraid that your paper doesn't just use a more focussed version. It just does this bit wrong! The key point is that it isn't legitimate to go to a fully resolved solution, measure a parameter (in your case the depth of the thermal boundary layer) and derive B from that. This is what you do. You might as well have just measured a typical buoyancy! The 'text book' approach is based purely on energy arguments given the buoyancy (and hence potential energy) you are pumping in from the bottom and the depth of the domain. From this one can implicitly derive an estimate of the kinetic energy of the flow (U^2=BH, where H is the depth of the fluid). Combine this with the idea that the flow carries most of the buoyancy flux (h = UB) and, voila, in 2 lines you have B (and also a velocity scale). (U, here, is what we teach UGs in boundary layer to be the 'free convective velocity scale', w_*.) This is sec 1.3 of the document I sent you with suggested rewrites for the paper. Defining the thermal boundary-layer depth (delta) as the depth over which diffusion carries the same flux is how we get an estimate for that depth now that we have an estimate of B (so alpha B/delta = h). If you measure it, of course you get roughly the same answer, so your B isn't wildly out, but it does differ quantitively from the 'right' answer, and your value, as said, relies on already having solved the problem so is derived the wrong way! One way or another you chose to ignore this and I could not countenance my name being on a paper that ignores the theory we teach at UG level!
