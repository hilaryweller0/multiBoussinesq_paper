Abstract
Multi-fluid modelling is a promising new method of representing sub- and near-grid-scale convection allowing for consistent and accurate treatment of net mass transport by convection and
of non-equilibrium dynamics . The air is partitioned into two or more fluids which may represent, for example, updrafts and the stable environment. Each fluid has its own velocity, temperature and constituents with separate equations of motion.
This paper presents two-fluid Boussinesq equations for representing under-resolved dry
convection with sinking and w = 0 air in fluid 0 and rising air in fluid 1. A model for entrainment and detrainment based on divergence leads to excellent representation of the convective area fraction. Previous multi-fluid modelling of convection has used the same pressure for
both fluids. This is shown to be a bad approximation and a model for the pressure difference
between the fluids based on divergence is presented.
Two vertical slice test cases are developed to tune parameters and to evaluate the twofluid equations for representing dry, sub-grid-scale convection: a buoyant rising bubble and
radiative convective equilibrium. These are first simulated at high resolution and conditionally averaged based on the sign of the vertical velocity. The test cases are next simulated with
the two-fluid model which reproduces the mean properties of the rising and falling fluids in
one column.

Plain Language Summary
Clouds and buoyant convection are often smaller than the grid size in weather and climate prediction models but they are of central importance. Therefore their effects are parameterised – their interactions with the larger scales are estimated based on properties of the larger
scales. Convection parameterisations are a large source of error in models of the atmosphere
despite decades of effort to improve them. An important assumption in most convection parameterisations is that convection moves heat and moisture upwards but not mass. This makes
it much simpler to incorporate convection parameterisations into existing models. Multi-fluid
modelling will enable mass transport by convection but the approach means a whole new atmospheric model rather than a stand alone routine that can be incorporated into an existing
model. This paper provides some closures necessary for multi-fluid modelling and evaluation
of the technique for two dimensional dry convection.

1 Introduction
Slow progress has been made improving the parameterisation of sub-grid-scale convection since Arakawa and Schubert (1974), Tiedtke (1989), Gregory and Rowntree (1990) and
Kain and Fritsch (1990). Convection is still one of the weakest aspects of large scale models of the atmosphere (Holloway & Co-authors, 2014; Sherwood et al., 2013; Solomon et al.,
2007). Improvements have been made by relaxing the quasi-equilibrium assumption (Pan &
Randall, 1998; Gerard & Geleyn, 2005; Park, 2014), including stochasticity (Plant & Craig,
2008) and allowing net mass transport by convection (Kuell & Bott, 2008; Malardel & Bechtold, 2019). These developments have enabled limited simulation in the grey zone, where convection is partially resolved. However there are still systematic biases implying that improvements should still be possible.
Lappen and Randall (2001) introduced the “assumed-distribution higher-order closure”
(ADHOC) parameterisation of the boundary layer and convection which solves prognostic equations for higher-order moments of the sub-grid-scale flow, such as the triple correlation of the
vertical velocity anomalies, and diagnoses updraft and downdraft means from the higher-order
moments. Thus all necessary statistics can be calculated from the grid-box-mean values that
are predicted by the dynamical core. Net mass transport by convection is included because it
is part of the grid-box-mean. ADHOC was extended by Golaz et al. (2002) to use bi-Gaussian

probability distribution functions rather than top-hat distributions to represent sub-grid-scale
variability. This formed the basis of the “Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals” (CLUBB) parameterization (Larson et al., 2012) which was first used at grey zone resolutions.
Thuburn et al. (2018) proposed multi-fluid modelling of convection in order to treat nonequilibrium and net mass transport consistently. The multi-fluids approach has an advantage
over ADHOC and CLUBB in solving prognostic equations for first-order moments directly
(mean properties of e.g. updraft and environment) rather than solving prognostic equations for
higher-order moments of the whole fluid in order to diagnose means of updrafts and the environment. Solving directly for first-order moments in each fluid could be less sensitive to closure assumptions. . Yano (2014) derived similar equations and showed how this is a generalisation of the mass-flux formulation. The Tan et al. (2018) “extended eddy diffusivity mass
flux” or extended EDMF scheme uses similar equations but Tan et al. (2018) only solve the
equations in a single column without coupling to the continuity equation of a dynamical core.
The disadvantage of the multi-fluids approach is that it requires a dedicated model rather than
being a stand alone parameterisation for a dynamical core. Thuburn et al. (2019) and Weller
and McIntyre (2019) presented solutions of two-fluid equations using the same pressure for
both fluids. . Thuburn et al. (2019) showed that these equations are in fact unstable and can
be stabilised by diffusion of vertical velocity whereas Weller and McIntyre (2019) stabilised
the equations with diffusion and drag between fluids. Neither of these stabilisation techniques
are acceptable; sufficient diffusion to stabilise the multi-fluid equations may smooth out real
features of the flow and the diffusion between fluids and drag used by Weller and McIntyre
(2019) meant that both fluids tended to move together rather than through each other. In this
paper we show that there are significant and sustained pressure differences between the fluids (section 4) and that the use of separate pressures stabilises the equations.
This paper presents the multi-fluid Boussinesq equations for representing sub-grid-scale
convection including a parameterisation of the pressure difference between fluids (section 2.2)
and a new model of entrainment and detrainment (section 2.3). The numerical method for solving the equations is described in section 3. Results of two vertical slice test cases are presented
in section 4. These are first simulated at high resolution in a single fluid model and then statistics of the flow are reproduced solving the two-fluid equations in one column.

2 The Multi-fluid Boussinesq Equations
2.1 Derivation
Many of the challenges of representing convection with the multi-fluid Navier-Stokes
equations (e.g. those described in Weller & McIntyre, 2019) carry over to the Boussinesq equations because convection is buoyancy dominated and close to incompressible. The resolved
test cases presented in section 4 give very similar results for Navier-Stokes and Buossinesq
equations. Therefore, the Boussinesq equations without background stratification are chosen
for simplicity:
∂u
+ ∇ · (uu) + ∇P = bk + ν∇2 u
∂t
∂b
+ ∇ · (ub) = α∇2 b
∂t
∇·u = 0
where variables are defined in table 1.
The single-fluid Boussinesq equations will be conditionally averaged following Thuburn
et al. (2018) to give the multi-fluid Boussinesq equations. Lagrangian labels, Ii , pick out different fluid types or regions. Ii = 1 in fluid i and 0 elsewhere. Ii satisfies Lagrangian conser-

where δ is the Dirac delta function representing the transfer rate between fluids and τi j (x) is

As the system is governed by the Boussinesq equations, it is assumed that variations in density only affect the definition of the buoyancy terms (table 1) so ui and bi are defined without density weighting.
To derive a transport equation for σi , (4) is combined with Ii times (3) and volume averaged. It is necessary to assume that operators permute with the averaging (as described by
Thuburn et al., 2018). This gives:

where σi Si j is the transfer rate from fluid i to j.
Next the conditional averaging of terms in the momentum (1) and buoyancy (2) equations is considered. Conditionally averaging the advection terms leads to sub-filter-scale fluxes,
FSF , since the velocity and buoyancy are not uniform within each fluid at the filter scale:
ui
Ii ∇ · (uu) = ∇ · (σi ui ui ) + FSF

(11)

bi
∇ · (σi ui bi ) + FSF

(12)

Ii ∇(ub) =

The sub-filter-scale fluxes will be absorbed into the diffusion terms for momentum and buoyancy. The diffusion terms are written so that, in the absence of transfers between fluids and
if both fluids are initialised to be identical, the fluids remain identical and σi acts as a passive
tracer:
Ii ν∇2 u

(14)

The pressures within each fluid are defined to as:
σi Pi = Ii P.

(15)

The pressure gradient can then be decomposed as:
h
i
Ii ∇P = σi ∇Pi + Pi ∇σi − P∇Ii

(16)

The terms in square brackets are the difference between the pressure force pushing outward
from the fluid calculated using resolved variables and the full resolved version of the same force,
both of which are related to drag. They will be represented by a drag, Di j . However this drag
is likely to be smaller than the drag that is used, for example in multi-phase modelling (e.g.
Guelfi et al., 2007) as it is representing the difference between two representations of drag,
rather than the whole drag. Sensitivity to Di j will be investigated in section 4.
Combining all terms gives the conditionally averaged momentum and buoyancy equations:
∂ σi ui
+ ∇ · (σi ui ui ) + σi ∇Pi
∂t


= σi bi k + νσi ∇2 ui + ∑ σ j S ji uTji − σi Si j uTij − σi Di j


∂ σi bi
+ ∇ · (σi ui bi ) = ασi ∇2 bi + ∑ σ j S ji bTji − σi Si j bTij .

j6=i

(18)

These equations include mass transfers between fluids with uTij being the velocity of the fluid
transferred from i to j and bTij being the buoyancy of the fluid transferred from i to j.
Eqns (17) and (18) are solved in advective form in which the mass transfer terms are
more complicated due to the mass transfer terms in 10:

2.2 Pressure of each fluid
Thuburn et al. (2019) and Weller and McIntyre (2019) used the same pressure for both
fluids. This led to unstable equations that Thuburn et al. (2019) stabilised using diffusion of
vertical velocity and Weller and McIntyre (2019) stabilised using mass exchanges or drag between the fluids. Thuburn et al. (2019) achieved realistic results in one column experiments
of the convective boundary layer but the amount of diffusion needed would spoil simulations
in the free troposphere by diffusing real features as well as spurious artifacts. The stabilisation used by Weller and McIntyre (2019) meant that the two fluids tended to move as one which
defeats the purpose of using multi-fluid modelling.
The instabilities reported by Weller and McIntyre (2019) showed growing divergence
in a fluid with vanishing volume fraction. For single-fluid equations, divergence would lead
to pressure anomalies which would act as a negative feedback on the divergence. However for
multi-fluids if one of the volume fractions is too small then it cannot force pressure anomalies big enough to stabilise the divergence. Use of a separate pressure for each fluid is therefore proposed to ensure stability.
It is assumed that the pressure in each fluid is given by a perturbation, pi , from the total pressure, P:
Pi = P + pi .

(22)

For stability and respect ∑i ∇·σi ui = 0, we propose four constraints on the pressure perturbations, pi :
1. ∑i σi pi = 0.
2. ui = u =⇒ pi = 0 so that pressure perturbations do not force individual fluid anomalies away from the mean.
3. pi 6→ 0 when σi → 0 so that pressure perturbations control divergence in vanishing fluids.
4. pi 6→ ∞ as σ j → 0 for any combination of i, j.
In order to derive a suitable form of parameterisation for pi we will first consider the
Baer and Nunziato (1986) model of multi-phase flow.
2.2.1 The Baer and Nunziato (1986) model
Baer and Nunziato (1986) proposed a parameterisation for pressure differences in a multiphase explosion model that has been widely used in mathematics and engineering for simulating, for example, fluidised beds of granular material (e.g. Embid et al., 1992) and two compressible fluids (e.g. Saurel & Abgrall, 1999). This model is not used here but is examined
in order to derive a parameterisation of pressure differences between fluids suitable for atmospheric convection. Saurel and Abgrall (1999) wrote transport equations for both the volume
fraction, σi , and for the mass fraction, σi ρi without transfers between fluids which in our notation are:
∂ σi
+ V · ∇σi
∂t

=

µ (Pi − Pj )

∂ σi ρi
+ ∇ · (σi ρi ui ) = 0
∂t

(23)
(24)

where V is the velocity of the interface between fluids, µ is the compaction viscosity which
controls how quickly the pressure of each fluid relaxes to the mean pressure and index j refers
to the other fluid in a two fluid system. Different authors make different assumptions about
the interface velocity. The combination of equations (23) and (24) shows that the pressure difference between fluids is related to divergence.

2.2.2 Proposed Model for Pressure Differences between Fluids
Thuburn et al. (2019) stabilised the multi-fluid equations by adding a diffusion term ν∂ w2 /∂ z2
to the RHS of the w equation. If a fluid perturbation pressure is set to pi = −ν∂ w/∂ z then
this is equivalent to the diffusion term in one dimension. However adding a diffusion term will
harm three dimensional simulations of resolved convection in the free troposphere whereas adding
a fluid perturbation pressure will not. Inspired by both Baer and Nunziato (1986) and Thuburn
et al. (2019) and obeying the constraints given above, the pressure in each fluid is chosen to
be:
pi = γ ∑ σ j ∇ · u j − γ∇ · ui
(25)
j

where γ is a compressibility with units
destroys energy conservation.

ms s−1 .

It should be noted that this parameterisation

Scale analysis in section 2.6 will inform the choice of γ and sensitivity to γ will be evaluated in section 4.
2.3 Entrainment and Detrainment
The transfers between fluids are related to entrainment, ε, and detrainment, δ . Fluid 0
is the environment and fluid 1 is updrafts implying:
S01 = w1 ε,

S10 = w0 δ .

(26)

Results using two formulations of entrainment are presented in section 4. The first is similar
to the dynamic entrainment described by Houghton and Cramer (1951), Asai and Kasahara
(1967) and de Rooy et al. (2013):
(
−∇ · ui if ∇ · ui < 0
(27)
Si j =
0
otherwise.
This formulation prevents one fluid from accumulating when a fluid decelerates (at the top of
a rising plume or at the bottom of descending air). A common form of lateral entrainment (e.g.
de Rooy et al., 2013) is also tested in section 4:
ε=

0.2
rc

(28)

where rc is the cloud or plume radius.
2.4 Drag in the Momentum Equation
Pressure differences between the fluids can lead to form drag which is parameterised following Simpson and Wiggert (1969), Romps and Charn (2015) and Weller and McIntyre (2019)
as:
σ jCD
|ui − u j | (ui − u j )
(29)
Di j =
rc
where CD is a drag coefficient, rc is a cloud radius. Sensitivity to CD /rc is explored in section
4.
2.5 The Buoyancy and the Momentum of the Mass that is Transferred
Each fluid may not be well mixed so the fluid transferred may not have the mean properties of the fluid it is leaving (as was assumed by Weller & McIntyre, 2019). A realistic estimate of the properties of the fluid transferred can only be based on knowledge of the subfilter-scale variability (i.e. the variability within each fluid). However, modelling of sub-filterscale variability is beyond the scope of this paper.

–7–

manuscript submitted to Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)

Since conditional averaging is based on the vertical velocity in this study, the sub-set
of fluid 0 that is about to rise (i.e. within the next timestep) should be transferred from fluid
0 to fluid 1, and vice versa for the fluid about to fall in fluid 1. The fluid transferred will therefore have a vertical velocity of w = 0. For three dimensional multi-fluid simulations one could
assume that the horizontal velocity transferred is equal to the mean horizontal velocity of the
fluid transferred from:
 
ui
uTij = vi  .
(30)
0
However, only one dimensional multi-fluid simulations are presented in this paper.
The buoyancy transferred follows Thuburn et al. (2019):
bTij = θb bi + (1 − θb )b j .

(31)

Results are presented using θb = 21 and θb = 1. θb = 1 is described as an upstream approximation by Yano (2014) and is widely used for entrainment (e.g. Asai & Kasahara, 1967; Arakawa
& Schubert, 1974). Note that θb 6= 1 implies that the buoyancy of the fluid transferred depends on the properties of the receiving fluid which is not logical and can lead to unbounded
values of bi in the fluid that is losing mass (as demonstrated in section 4).
The model bTij = 0 is also tested. The rationale is that if fluid zero contains negatively
buoyant air and fluid one contains positively buoyant air then the air that is transferred has zero
buoyancy.
2.6 Scale Analysis
Scale analysis can guide our choice of γ for the parameterisation of the pressure difference between fluids using the following assumptions:
1.
2.
3.
4.

The flow is buoyancy dominated.
The flow is close to inviscid.
The flow is slowly varying.
Fluid i properties are anomalies from a neutrally stable resting mean state implying that
the average over all fluids of bi , ui and Pi are zero.
5. Only the vertical direction is considered where wTij = 0.
6. Pi = P + γ ∑ j σ j ∇ · u j − γ∇ · ui ≈ −γ∇ · ui = −γ ∂∂wzi
7. ∂∂σzi ≈ 0
8. There are two fluids, 0 and 1.
9. Without loss of generality, the transfers Si j = − ∂∂wzi > 0 and S ji = 0 are used.
10. The drag term, Di j , is zero.
These assumptions can be used to simplify the multi-fluid w equation, (19):
∂ w2i
∂ 2 wi

This is non-dimensionalised using a length scale L, a buoyancy scale B and a time scale T to

The stabilisation term must be large enough to smooth out oscillations in w̃ due to advection

(35)

This will be used to guide the choice of γ in section 4.

3 Numerical Method
The spatial discretisation follows exactly Weller and McIntyre (2019), solving advective form equations using monotonic, finite volume advection and C-grid, Lorenz staggering.
The time-stepping is Crank-Nicolson with no off-centering and with deferred correction of explicitly solved variables. The method for calculating a separate pressure for each fluid is new
because Weller and McIntyre (2019) solved the Euler equations with a single pressure. Two
outer iterations per timestep are used to update explicitly solved variables. For the first outer
iteration, predicted values for time n+1 are set to those from time level n and are given the
superscript `. For the second iteration, values at ` are set to those from the end of the first iteration. The implicit numerical method for applying the transfers between fluids is specific
for two fluids because it involves the inversion of 2 × 2 matrices.
The prognostic variables are bi in cell centres, σi in cell centres and the velocity flux
at cell faces, ui = ui ·S, which is the velocity at cell faces dotted with the area vector for each
face (normal to the face). The pressures, P and pi are diagnostic and are located at cell centres.
The first calculation of each outer iteration is for the transfer terms, Si j using (27) or (28).
Next (10) is solved for each σi , operator split; first applying advection, then correcting ∑i σi =
1 and finally applying mass transfers:

where ∆t is the time step and the superscripts 0 and 00 denote intermediate values. σin is interpolated from cell centres onto cell faces using monotonic van Leer advection (operator (σin )vL )
as in Weller and McIntyre (2019) and values exclusively at time level n for best accuracy and
guaranteed monotonicity. For calculating the divergence, the normal component of ui is needed
at cell faces which are prognostic variables of the C-grid. The Si j are limited to ensure 0 <
σi < 1 ∀i.
Next eqn (20) is solved for the buoyancy in each fluid, first transporting buoyancy and
then applying the transfer terms. The advection term, ui ∇bi is split into ∇ · (ui bi ) − bi ∇ · ui
for better conservation as calculated by the finite volume method. The transfer terms can be

very large due to the presence of σij Si j in the transfer term for bi so they are treated opera–9–

Next a Poisson equation is solved to calculate the total pressure, P to ensure that the total velocity is divergence free. This is the standard approach for ensuring divergence constraints
(e.g. Smolarkiewicz et al., 2014). The pressure equation also provides updates for the velocity flux, ui . First an intermediate velocity flux is calculated with partial updates and updates
from a previous value of pi but without updates from ∇Pn+1 :

where operator () f means linear interpolation from cell centres onto cell faces and ∇ f P is a
compact discretisation of (∇P) f ·S: i.e. the normal component of the pressure gradient calculated from just the values of pressure either side of the face. Once Pn+1 is calculated, the

The final stage of the time step iteration is to reconstruct ui from ui following Weller
and McIntyre (2019). The stages calculating P, pi and ui are repeated twice per time step iteration. The Poisson and Helmholtz equations are solved to a tolerance of 10−6 using the OpenFOAM conjugate gradient solver with incomplete Cholesky preconditioning.
3.1 Discrete Conditional Averaging
A single-fluid solution is conditionally averaged by:
(
0 if w ≤ 0
i=
1 otherwise.

(50)

If an entire grid box is assigned to be either in fluid 0 or fluid 1 based on w at the cell centre then σ can only take a small number of discrete values depending on the resolution of the
conditional averaging. For example, if conditional averaging goes from n columns to 1 column with vertical resolution staying the same, then σ can only take values nk where k is an
integer between zero and n. This means that σ is either uniform (for small n) or has jumps
in the vertical (for larger n). An alternative is therefore proposed in order to approximate σ
based on w and ∇w at cell centres. This is based on the intersection between a grid box and
the surface of w = 0. Given a grid box with centre xc , the surface of points, xw of w = 0 satisfy:
∇w · (xc − xw ) = 0
(51)
Rather than the expense of calculating exact grid box volume fractions either side of this surface, the signed distance of each grid box vertex, xv , to the surface is calculated:

4 Evaluation Test Cases
Two test cases are developed to tune parameters and to evaluate the use of two-fluid equations to represent dry, two-dimensional, sub-grid-scale convection. The first is transient; the
standard rising bubble of Bryan and Fritsch (2002). The second is steady state with heat transfer at the ground and uniform radiative cooling (radiative convective equilibrium). For both
test cases, the reference solution is a single-fluid solution of the two-dimensional Boussinesq
equations at high horizontal and vertical resolution. These will be compared with the two-fluid
model run using one column. The aim is to reproduce the vertical heat transport, the mean velocity of the rising air, the bouyancy of the rising air and the pressure differences between fluids in one column of the two-fluid model.
4.1 Rising Bubble
The two dimensional test case of Bryan and Fritsch (2002) was designed for fully compressible inviscid models but similar solutions are obtained solving inviscid Boussinesq equations (ν = 0, α = 0). The Boussinesq version has no background stratification in a domain

4.1.1 Single-Fluid Solutions
The solution of the Boussinesq equations in two dimensions for the rising bubble at high
resolution is shown in figure 1, at the initial time, 500 seconds and 1000 seconds, with buoyancy coloured, pressure contoured and the w = 0 contour dotted. The solution is very similar to the fully compressible solution (Bryan & Fritsch, 2002). The pressure gradients accelerate the flow beneath the bubble, decelerate the flow above the bubble and pull in air horizontally. The w = 0 contour at the initial time shows the initial tendency of w which demonstrates that there is no straightforward relationship between buoyancy and w; w is the solution of an elliptic problem involving the momentum equation and the divergence free constraint.
After 500 seconds the centre of the bubble has risen further than the edges and after 1000 seconds there is a complex region of entrainment inside the bubble consisting of both buoyant
and neutral rising air and buoyant and neutral sinking air. It is unlikely that the simple parameterisations proposed here will be able to reproduce statistics of this complex behaviour.
Thuburn et al. (2019) and Weller and McIntyre (2019) used the same pressure for both
fluids with differences parameterised as drag. The high pressure above and low pressure below the bubble in figure 1 are a manifestation of form drag and will act to slow the ascent.
However the pressure patterns in figure 1 also show the limitations of this approach; the low
pressure region at the bottom of the bubble will also act to accelerate the rising flow into the
bubble which is not accounted for by drag and there are also widespread pressure anomalies
in the sinking fluid which will accelerate the descent whereas drag will always act to slow the
fluid.
Large scale models of the atmosphere often have coarse horizontal resolution and relatively fine vertical resolution. The high resolution solution is horizontally averaged, conditioned based on the sign of w, to give the vertical profiles that coarse resolution models or parameterisations should reproduce. Sinking air and air with w = 0 is assigned to fluid 0 and
rising air to fluid 1 and an average is taken over the x direction at time t = 1000 s to give the
profiles shown in the top row of figure 2. σ1 is the volume fraction of rising fluid at every height
and b0 and b1 , w0 and w1 and P0 and P1 are the average buoyancy, vertical velocity and pressure of the rising and falling fluids. σ1 varies little with height. The complex shape of the bubble is evident in b0 which has two peaks; the lower peak associated with re-entrained air. The
fastest ascent is at the bottom of the bubble, co-located with a large drop in pressure.
In order to see what happens in a single fluid atmospheric model at modest horizontal
resolution without a parameterisation of convection, the bubble is simulated at coarser horizontal resolutions, using nine, five, three and one columns instead of the 200 columns of the
fine resolution to cover the 20km wide domain and a vertical space of ∆z = 100 m. The conditional and horizontal averages of these simulations are shown in figure 2 These simulations
are initialised by conservative horizontal averaging from the full resolution solution. As the
horizontal resolution is reduced, the vertical transport reduces until there is no movement at
all for the one column simulation: there is no possibility of fluid rising because in one column with a single-fluid there can be no compensating subsidence. The lack of vertical transport at coarse resolution motivates convection parameterisation.

4.1.2 Results of the Two-fluid, One Column Simulations
Two-fluid, one column simulations are initialised by horizontally and conditionally averaging the high resolution single-fluid initial conditions. Sinking air is put into fluid zero and
rising air into fluid one. The velocity field after one time step is used for initialisation as the
air is stationary at t = 0. Results after 500 seconds are shown in figures 3 and 4 for various
assumptions about transfers between fluids and various parameter values.
The solutions in the top row of figure 3 have no drag between fluids, no transfers, no
diffusion and the pressures of both fluids are assumed equal meaning that the multi-fluid equations should be unstable (Thuburn et al., 2019). The simulation with Si j = 0 in the top row
of figure 3 actually has small transfers to prevent either σi from becoming negative. This is
sufficient to stabilise the solution but does not prevent oscillations from developing in all fields.
The buoyant fluid has risen little from the initial conditions. σ1 oscillates between zero and
one meaning that only one fluid is present at some locations so there is no possibility for the
fluids to move past each other. The two fluids have mixed due to the two way stabilising transfers which have reduced the buoyancy in the rising fluid and increased the buoyancy in the
sinking fluid.
Including entrainment and detrainment as Si j = −∇·ui stabilises the solution and leads
to a realistic rising volume fraction (second row of figure 3). The fluids move a little further
past each other even without pressure differences between the fluids. However there is too much
mixing between the fluids and a discontinuity arises at the bubble leading edge; the buoyancy
force is producing vertical motion but there is no pressure to make it smooth.
Using entrainment and detrainment set by divergence (Si j = −∇·ui ) and pressure difference between the fluids controlled by divergence (Pi = P+γ ∑ j σ j ∇·u j −γ∇·ui ), the simulations are more realistic (bottom three rows of figure 3). The first value, γ = 2.3×104 m2 s−1 ,
is set from equation (35) using length scale equal to the initial bubble radius and a buoyancy
scale equal to the initial maximum buoyancy. This makes the velocity profile too smooth and
the updraft too weak so the bubble does not rise enough. It is reasonable to consider smaller
values of γ because the buoyancy does not retain its initial maximum for very long. Using γ =
104 m2 s−1 gives more accurate solutions whereas using γ = 4×103 m2 s−1 leads to the leading edge of the bubble rising too quickly and does not fully remove the discontinuity in the
updraft velocity at the leading edge of the bubble. The pressure differences between the fluids have some similarity with the resolved simulation but none of the values of γ reproduce
the pressure dip at the trailing edge of the bubble. γ = 104 m2 s−1 gives the closest approximation to the resolved simulation.
The results in the top row of figure 4 use divergence transfer and pressure differences
between fluids but, different from previous simulations, also use drag set by CD /rc = 1/2000m−1 .
The drag slows the updrafts without increasing the mixing between the fluids which makes
the solutions less like the resolved simulations. Although drag is known to be an important
term in the momentum equations for buoyant thermals and plumes (e.g., Romps & Charn, 2015),
the drag is related to pressure differences caused by the relative motion and to mixing with
downdraft air. The mixing with downdraft air is already accounted for in the entrainment and
the pressure differences are already accounted for in the pressure parameterisation. Therefore
the drag parameterisation is not a useful contribution to the multi-fluid Boussinesq equations.
If pressure differences between fluids are included with γ = 104 m2 s−1 without entrainment (Si j = 0) (second row of figure 4) the fluids move past each other but there is a build
up of fluid 1 at the leading edge of the bubble and very little fluid 1 below the bubble. With
one column and two fluids, all air must rise in one fluid and sink in the other. Continuity does
not allow for any other solution. Pressure gradients can accelerate or decelerate this flow but
as the model is set up, with no transfers between fluids, no fluid can change direction. It is
therefore essential to have transfers between fluids.

Results of the rising bubble at t = 1000 s. Solid lines are the multi-fluid, one column solutions of

the rising bubble. Dashed lines are the single-fluid, resolved solutions.

The other entrainment option is the commonly used fractional entrainment rate, ε = 0.2/rc .
This is used in combination with with pressure differences between fluids in the third row of
figure 4. The solutions are smooth but the rising volume fraction is not right with a build up
of fluid 1 at the bubble leading edge, the updraft is too weak and too much is entrained into
fluid 1 above the bubble. Using this entrainment, the updraft will entrain more and more air
until σ1 = 1. The Si j = −∇ · ui model gives results closer to the reference solution.
Two alternative models for estimating the buoyancy of the fluid transferred between updraft and downdraft have been tested. The results in the fourth row of figure 4 assume that
the fluid transferred has zero buoyancy in order to keep the positively buoyant air in fluid one
and the negatively buoyant air in fluid 0. Thus when zero buoyancy air leaves fluid one (the
updraft), the mean buoyancy of fluid one increases. This leads to higher buoyancy in fluid one
than when using bTij = bi and gives results close to the reference solution. The results in the
bottom row of figure 4 use bTij = 12 (b0 + b1 ) following Thuburn et al. (2019) so that the fluid
transferred is influenced by the fluid it is moving towards as well as where it has come from.
These solutions are also similar to the resolved solutions.

From the results at 500 seconds, we can conclude that:
•

•

•
•

Divergence transfer (entrainment and detrainment) leads to realistic updraft area fractions.
Pressure differences between fluids are usefully modelled by divergence, with a coefficient close to the derived value from scale analysis.
Drag terms are not useful.
Entrainment calculated as the reciprocal of plume width is not useful.

In order to examine further the effects of different assumptions about the buoyancy of the fluid
transferred, a selection of results at 1000 seconds are presented in figure 5. None of the simulations reproduce the complex buoyancy pattern at the trailing edge of the bubble associated
with a deep low pressure. The rising air fraction (σ1 ) at and below the bubble is too low in
all simulations. The top row which uses bTij = bi (transferring the mean buoyancy) shows too
much mixing between the fluids – too much of the most buoyant air has been transferred out
of fluid 1 but the leading edge of the bubble has risen about the right amount. In the other two
simulations, the air that is transferred out of fluid 1 has lower buoyancy than the mean in fluid
1 (bT10 < b1 ) so the remaining rising fluid stays very buoyant and rises too far. The assumption that the buoyancy transferred is zero (middle row of figure 5) means that the buoyant fluid
increases its buoyancy above the initial conditions which would not be possible in the resolved
single-fluid solution.
It might be possible to improve aspects of this simulation by optimising γ and θb (the
coefficient from eqn (31) for calculating bTij ) but it is probably not helpful to over fit the twofluid model to this dry, two dimensional test case. There are clearly discrepancies between the
single-fluid resolved rising bubble and the two fluid one column rising bubble but rather than
trying to fit this test case closely, cases with multiple plumes in each column should be considered. Using the lessons learned from modelling the rising bubble, a statistically stationary
case with many plumes is simulated next.
4.2 Radiative-Convective Equilibrium (RCE)
A two-dimensional, dry radiative convective equilibrium test case is devised to mimic
some properties of atmospheric convection, in particular the difficulty resolving the flow at coarse
resolution. The domain is 160km wide, 10km tall and is resolved by 640 cells in the horizontal and 40 in the vertical (∆x = ∆z = 250m). The top and bottom boundaries are zero velocity and the lateral boundaries are periodic. A heat flux of h = 10−3 m2 s−3 is imposed at the
bottom boundary leading to a boundary condition of ∂ b/∂ z = −h/αs−2 where α = 100 m2 s−1
is the buoyancy diffusivity. The top boundary has ∂ b/∂ z = 0. Diffusion is applied to the momentum equation with a coefficient ν = 70.7 m2 s−1 so as to give a Prandtl number of 0.707,
the value for dry air. Uniform cooling of −1×10−7 ms−3 is applied to the domain to maintain equilibrium.
The fluid is initially stationary with b = 0. In order to quickly and reproducibly initialise
instability, b = 10−4 m2 s−1 is imposed in a square of side length 2000m at the centre in the
x direction and at the ground. The simulation is run using a time step of 5 s. A quasi-steady,
choatic state is reached after about 3×104 s and the simulation is run for 2×105 s and conditional averages are calculated over the final 105 s.
This test case is designed to have strong updrafts in narrow plumes and weak descent
elsewhere to mimic atmospheric convection but without the complication of moisture, phase
changes and three spatial dimensions.

Buoyancy, vertical velocity and pressure at t = 2 × 105 s of the resolved radiative-convective

equilibrium test case. Vertical velocity contours are black every 0.5m/s with negative contours dashed and the
zero contour dotted. The domain is 10km high and 160km wide and the z-direction is stretched a factor of 2
in the plots.

4.2.1 Single-Fluid Solutions
A snapshot of the buoyancy, vertical velocity and pressure of the radiative-convective
equilibrium test case at 2×105 s are shown in figure 6 showing intense, narrow updrafts. The
buoyant air at the ground rises in narrow plumes, accelerating due to buoyancy and pressure
gradients then decelerating due to pressure gradients before reaching the top. The plumes spread
out and the sinking air is a mixture of warm and cold with similar pressure gradients in the
rising and falling air, accelerating then decelerating the flow so as to maintain continuity.
Horizontal averages conditioned on w and time averaged every 1000s between 105 s and
2×105 s are shown as dashed lines in figure 7. The rising and falling volume fractions, σ1
and σ0 , remain close to 12 throughout the depth. The rising plumes look narrow in figure 6 but
there are wide regions of slowly rising air around the plume cores. The entrained rising cool
air and warm air sinking that has hit the model top mean that the rising and falling air have
similar average buoyancy away from the ground. The ascending air gradually accelerates towards the middle of the domain then decelerates towards the model top. At the ground the acceleration is forced by buoyancy and away from the ground the acceleration is controlled by
pressure gradients. The descending air mean velocity is close to equal and opposite to the ascending air, as expected since σ1 = 0.5.
4.2.2 Results of the Two-fluid, One Column Simulations
The two fluid model is used to simulate the RCE test case in one column of 40 cells with
zero buoyancy gradient at the top and a buoyancy gradient of 10−5 s−2 at the ground for both
fluids and uniform radiative cooling. The two fluids are initialised using the time mean conditional horizontal averages from the single-fluid resolved simulation. The entrainment model
Si j = −∇·ui is used for all simulations to account for transfers throughout the domain to represent cloud base mass flux (at the bottom boundary), cloud top detrainment and lateral entrainment. γ is set from equation (35) using the depth of the super adiabatic layer as the length
scale (L = 800m) and the buoyancy scale B = L ∂ b/∂ z = 8×10−3 ms−2 giving γ = 2000m2 s−1 .
A simulation using Si j = −∇ · ui , no drag and bTij = bi is shown in the top row of figure 7.
The entrainment model Si j = −∇·ui keeps σi at about 0.5 throughout the depth, as in the resolved simulation, with entrainment in the lower half of the domain (S01 > 0) and detrainment
in the upper half (S10 > 0), where the air decelerates towards the top. The one column model

Results of the RCE simulations. Dashed lines show horizontal averages of the resolved case

reproduces the super-adiabatic layer near the ground and the near uniform buoyancy away from
the ground but the buoyancy difference between the fluids is too large. The updraft and downdraft velocities are captured well. The pressure differences between fluids are too large which
is consistent with the over estimated buoyancy difference between fluids.
Results of a simulation using bTij = 21 (b0 +b1 ) is shown in the bottom row of figure 7.
This model of the buoyancy of the transferred fluid is not helpful; it leads to strong cooling
in fluid zero near the ground due to the large transfers. It is more accurate to assume that fluids take their mean properties when transferred, bTij = bi .
The two-fluid, one column model of RCE gave results closer to the reference solution
than for the rising bubble. This is likely to be because the rising and falling fluids in the RCE
test case are averaged over a large area with plumes at different stages of development rather
than trying to simulate the complex entrainment pattern behind a single bubble.

5 Summary, Conclusions and Further Work
This paper demonstrates the plausible utility of using multi-fluid equations to represent
sub-grid-scale convection. Solutions of the two-fluid Boussinesq equations using coarse horizontal resolution (one column) reproduce aspects of highly resolved single-fluid simulations
of dry, two-dimensional convection. Two test cases are used to evaluate the multi-fluid model.
The first is a Boussinesq version of the well known two dimensional dry rising bubble of Bryan
and Fritsch (2002) and the second is a dry two dimensional version of radiative-convective equilibrium with heating at the ground and uniform radiative cooling. High resolution single-fluid
simulations are conditionally averaged based on the sign of vertical velocity (w) in order to
define rising and falling fluids which each have their own buoyancy, velocity and pressure.
The two-fluid, one column Boussinesq model reproduces mean vertical heat and mass transport of these test cases.

The multi-fluid Boussinesq equations can have divergence in each fluid while the divergence averaged over all fluids is constrained to be zero by the single-fluid Boussinesq equations. A model is proposed and evaluated for the pressure difference between the rising and
falling fluids based on the divergence of each fluid. The use of a different pressure for each
fluid is not only realistic but also leads to stable solutions of the multi-fluid equations.
Conditionally averaging the high resolution solutions based on w leads to rising and falling
fluids with area fractions, σi , which are approximately uniform with height. Models for entrainment and detrainment into and out of these regions need to be consistent with the definition of the convecting region. A model for entrainment and detrainment based on divergence
is proposed that leads to excellent agreement with σ from the high resolution solutions. A more
conventional fractional entrainment rate based on the reciprocal of the plume width is also tested
which leads to unrealistic rising area fractions.
The properties of the fluid that are transferred from one fluid to another are unknowns
in the multi-fluid equations and these require closure. An obvious first guess is that fluid takes
its mean buoyancy and velocity with it when it is transferred. Improvements on this assumption will depend on knowledge of sub-filter-scale variablity. However since conditional averaging is based on the sign of w, it is consistent to assume that the fluid transferred has w =
0 (wTij = 0). Three models for the buoyancy of the fluid transferred are tested. The most successful is to assume that the fluid takes its mean buoyancy with it (bTij = bi ). Assuming that
the buoyancy of the transferred fluid is an average of the buoyancy of both fluids (bTij = 21 (bi +
b j )) can lead to unrealistically large or small, unbounded buoyancies. Assuming that one fluid
has negative buoyancy and the other positive buoyancy and fluid of zero buoyancy is transferred (bTij = 0) also leads to unbounded buoyancy.
One column multi-fluid modelling with moisture has already been demonstrated by Thuburn
et al. (2019) and two dimensional simulations of the multi-fluid Euler equations by Weller and
McIntyre (2019). Two important next steps are to simulate convection in the grey zone (where
it is partially resolved) and to represent sub-filter-scale variability within each fluid by solving multi-fluid prognostic equations for turbulent kinetic energy and other moments of the subfilter variability. Cloud base mass flux could then be estimated based on higher-order moments
of the vertical velocity and buoyancy within the environment fluid. This will lead to a unified parameterisation of turbulence and convection and will take multi-fluid modelling of convection beyond existing paradigms.
