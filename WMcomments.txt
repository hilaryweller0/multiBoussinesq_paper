For the page 15 comment:
I interpretted the text such that you initialise the 2-fluid 1-col using the time-horizontal average after t=2x10^5s.
I was curious if you get similar results if you initialise using horizontal average initialisation from t=0 (although I just realised this would be complicated due to the square buoyancy anomaly initial condition, so adding this probably isn't necessary).
