Multi-fluid modelling promises more accurate and consistent convection parameterisation including mass transport and non-equilibrium.

Entrainment and detrainment between fluids are calculated from divergence. This gives accurate parameterisation for 2D dry test cases.

The pressure difference between fluids is estimated based on divergence. This is accurate and renders the multi-fluid equations stable.
